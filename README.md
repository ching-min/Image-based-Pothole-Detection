# Image-based Pothole Detection
Pothole is one of the problems in city. In this project, we decided to use the Machine Learning methods - SVM and Logistic Regression, and Deep Learning Method - CNN to detect whether the image include the pothole or not. 
	
This project also have an application for users to upload an image and get the result. This application was implemented by HTML and python. For the application detail, please refer to the application note, and find the application at https://drive.google.com/open?id=1CjjlghGkJvECX--5ZWBj2O268AoBUTxz.
	
Future work: (i) detect the object in time and (ii) can upload more than one image in application.
